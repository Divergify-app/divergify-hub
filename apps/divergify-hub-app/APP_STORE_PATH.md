# App store path (Capacitor-ready)

This repo is set up so the app can be packaged as a native app later using Capacitor.

What is already done:
- Web app (Vite/React/TS)
- PWA installability (manifest + service worker)
- Capacitor config file present (capacitor.config.ts)

What you still need later:
- Apple Developer account (for App Store)
- Google Play Console account (for Play Store)
- Native build environments (Xcode on macOS for iOS; Android Studio for Android)
- Real app icons, screenshots, and privacy policy text

The app is already usable as:
- A normal website
- An installable PWA on mobile/desktop
