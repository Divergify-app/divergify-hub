# Divergify Hub App

Local-first productivity app (web + PWA) built for neurodivergent-friendly workflows.

## Dev
npm install
npm run dev

## Build
npm run build
npm run preview

## Deploy into the Divergify site
Use the helper script from the repo root:
./scripts/build_app_into_site.sh

## Takota check-in note
The check-in uses a single visual analog scale (VAS-style) slider to reduce choice overload while still capturing a fast, low-burden self-report of current stimulation. This keeps the interaction minimal without making medical claims.
